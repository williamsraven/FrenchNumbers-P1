# FrenchNumbers-Assignment P1
- Raven Williams
- I used Visual Basic 2022 as my development platformm
- Some of the issues I ran into were syntax related which took me a while to find where the error had been made. I also had to figure out how I wanted to make sure that none of the other numbers would show up once the new number french number would be displayed
